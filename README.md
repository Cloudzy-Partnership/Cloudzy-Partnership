We are actively looking for software vendors to feature on our **One-Click Marketplace**.

* **Existing Apps:** If your app is already supported on Cloudzy (like **n8n VPS**, **Mikrotik VPS**, or Docker), let's collaborate on co-marketing and tutorials.

#### 2. 💻 Affiliate & Agency Partners
* **Affiliates:** Earn recurring commissions by referring developers to our low-latency VPS solutions.
* **Agencies:** Get exclusive B2B rates and dedicated support for your clients' infrastructure.
